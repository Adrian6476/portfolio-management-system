## üîß Git Repository Setup

### 1. Create Remote Repository

**Option A: GitHub (Recommended for Training)**
```bash
# Create repository on GitHub
# Repository name: portfolio-management-system
# Description: Microservices-based Portfolio Management System
# Visibility: Private (for team collaboration)

# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio-management-system.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Pick Task] --> B[Create Feature Branch]
    B --> C[Develop & Test]
    C --> D[Commit with Convention]
    D --> E[Push & Create PR]
    E --> F[Code Review]
    F --> G[Merge to Main]
    G --> H[Deploy to Staging]
```

### Branch Naming Convention
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/portfolio-dashboard
feature/market-data-integration
feature/real-time-notifications

# Bug fixes
fix/database-connection-issue
fix/api-authentication-error

# Hotfixes
hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Documentation

```

### Commit Message Examples
```bash
# Good commits (following existing convention)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch        # Watch mode for development
pnpm test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

### Backend Testing
```bash
# In each service directory
go test ./...          # Run all tests
go test -v ./...       # Verbose output
go test -cover ./...   # Coverage report
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Full system testing
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
```

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
```bash
# Local development (each developer)
pnpm install
pnpm run setup
pnpm run dev
```

### Staging Environment
```bash
# Automated deployment on merge to main
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

### Production Deployment

## üéØ Success Metrics

**Technical Goals:**

- ‚úÖ Test coverage > 70%
- ‚úÖ No critical bugs in main branch

**Team Goals:**
- ‚úÖ Daily standups completed
- ‚úÖ All PRs reviewed within 24 hours
- ‚úÖ Git commit conventions followed
- ‚úÖ Documentation kept up-to-date
- ‚úÖ Team members learning and contributing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Scope Creep:** Stick to minimal viable product first
2. **Merge Conflicts:** Regular pulls from main branch
3. **Code Reviews:** Don't merge without review
4. **Testing:** Write tests as you develop, not after
5. **Communication:** Over-communicate rather than under-communicate

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Git Issues
```bash
# Merge conflicts
git status
git merge --abort  # If needed
git pull origin main
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"

# Sync with main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-feature-branch
git rebase main
```

### Development Issues
- Check Docker containers: `docker-compose ps`
- View logs: `docker-compose logs -f service-name`
- Reset environment: `pnpm run clean && pnpm run setup`

**Next Steps:** Proceed to implement this collaboration setup step by step. Each team member should review this guide and confirm their understanding before starting development.
