2. Look for issues labeled with your focus area:
   - `backend` for backend developers
   - `frontend` for frontend developer
   - `good-first-issue` for first-time contributors
3. Assign yourself to an issue
4. Move it to "In Progress" on the project board

### 2. Create Feature Branch

# Always start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Example branch names:
# feature/portfolio-crud-operations
# feature/market-data-integration
# feature/dashboard-charts
```

### 3. Development Process
```bash
# Make your changes
# Run tests frequently
pnpm test

# Commit following conventions
git add .
git commit  # This will show commit template

# Example good commit:
# feat(portfolio): add CRUD operations for holdings
```

### 4. Submit Pull Request
```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create PR on GitHub
# Use the PR template that appears
# Request review from team lead
```

## üìö Key Documentation

### Must Read First

## üîç Code Standards & Guidelines

### Frontend Code Standards (Next.js/TypeScript)
```typescript
// Use TypeScript for all new code
interface Portfolio {
  id: string;
  holdings: Holding[];
  totalValue: number;
}

// Use proper component structure
export const PortfolioDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Portfolio Dashboard</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

// Use Zustand for state management
interface PortfolioStore {
  portfolio: Portfolio | null;
  setPortfolio: (portfolio: Portfolio) => void;
}
```

### Backend Code Standards (Go)
```go
// Use proper package structure
package handlers

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gorilla/mux"
)

// Use proper error handling
func (h *Handler) GetPortfolio(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    portfolio, err := h.portfolioService.GetPortfolio(r.Context())
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Failed to get portfolio", http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }
    
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(portfolio)
}

// Use structured logging
log.Info("Processing portfolio request", 
    "user_id", userID,
    "request_id", requestID)
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage

# Type checking
pnpm run type-check
```

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd services/portfolio-service

# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific test
go test -run TestGetPortfolio
```

## üêõ Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Find and kill process using port
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

**Docker issues:**
```bash
# Reset Docker environment
pnpm run clean
docker system prune -f
pnpm run setup
```

**pnpm installation issues:**
```bash
# Clear pnpm cache
pnpm store prune
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

**Git commit rejected:**
```bash
# Your commit message doesn't follow convention
# Use the template:
git commit  # Shows template
# Or format manually:
git commit -m "feat(service): description of change"
```
